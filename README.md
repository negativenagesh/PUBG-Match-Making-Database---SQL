## Overview
This project presents a sophisticated database design for PUBG Mobile's matchmaking system. It aims to enhance the player experience by implementing an advanced matchmaking algorithm that considers a wide range of player attributes and performance metrics.


## Key features

1. **Comprehensive Player Profiling:**
   - Tracks account level, F/D ratio, merit, clan affiliation, and more
   - Stores player achievements, titles, and avatars

2. **Advanced Matchmaking Criteria:**
   - Considers region, language preference, tier, MMR, and season rank
   - Implements dynamic adjustments for balanced gameplay

3. **Normalized Database Schema:**
   - Designed up to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
   - Optimized for data integrity and efficiency

4. **Complex Query Capabilities:**
   - Enables detailed player and match analysis
   - Supports intricate data retrieval scenarios

5. **Real-time Data Management:**
   - Utilizes triggers for automatic data updates
   - Ensures consistency across related data points

6. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implements views for efficient data access
   - Includes stored procedures and functions for complex operations

7. **Flexible Game Mode Handling:**
   - Supports various game modes (Ranked, Unranked, Arena, etc.)
   - Tracks map preferences and event participation

8. **Detailed Match Statistics:**
   - Records in-game performance metrics
   - Calculates derived attributes like match duration
